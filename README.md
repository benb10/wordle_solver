# wordle_solver

This is a tool which automatically solves wordle puzzles (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
It can simulate games and the solver will automatically make guesses to attempt to solve the puzzle.
The algorithm will narrow down guesses based on what it has learnt from previous guesses.

## How to Run:

No dependencies required (just uses python standard library).

1. cd into wordle_solver directory
2. `python3 main.py`
